# PPI_Bioinformatics

In this project, we started by testing different machine
learning models: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gaussian
Naive Bayes, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector
Machines. All of these machine learning models are
supervised, and this feature requires labels. All the necessary
information was extracted from a dataset provided to us.

After verifying which one got the best parameters using the
most embracing dataset, we chose the best one to go on.
Our goals include seeing which is the best and most efficient
supervised machine learning algorithm, which is the best
embedding combination operation, and the main goal is the
prediction protein-protein interaction using a learning
machine model.
